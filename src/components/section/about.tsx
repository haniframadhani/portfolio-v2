          I am a web designer and developer based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, with
          a strong foundation in modern web technologies and a commitment to
          delivering reliable, high-quality digital solutions. I work with HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, MongoDB, and MySQL, and have
          hands-on experience using frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS,
          React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-300 mx-5 mt-2 text-lg md:text-xl text-justify md:text-start">
          Beyond technical implementation, I bring a design-driven
          approach—crafting interfaces that are not only visually clean but also
          intuitive and user-focused. I am comfortable working independently or
          collaborating within a team, adapting to project needs with
          professionalism and accountability. With a balance of technical
          expertise and design sensibility, I aim to build solutions that
          support long-term growth, trust, and success for the projects I
          contribute to.
